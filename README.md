## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

This section focuses on enhancing raw data by creating meaningful features that improve model performance. Specifically, it includes:

1. **📅 Calendric Features**  
   - Extract date-related components such as `day`, `month`, `weekday`, `weekend`, and `is_holiday` from datetime columns.  
   - Useful for capturing time-based patterns in behavior or trends.

2. **⏰ Peak Hour Identification**  
   - Identify and encode peak usage hours based on domain-specific definitions (e.g., morning/evening rush hours, business hours).  
   - Helps in modeling time-sensitive events like traffic, electricity demand, or customer activity.

These engineered features help models better understand time dependencies and improve predictive accuracy.
